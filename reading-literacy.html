									<p>We bring the best research-based strategies to teachers, parents, administrators, librarians, childcare providers, and anyone else involved in helping a young child become a skilled, confident reader. Our goal is to bring the reading research to life — to spread the word about reading instruction and to present "what works" in a way that parents and educators can understand and use.</p>

                                    <p>Fluency is the ability to read "like you speak." Hudson, Lane, and Pullen define fluency this way: "Reading fluency is made up of at least three key elements: accurate reading of connected text at a conversational rate with appropriate prosody or expression." Non-fluent readers suffer in at least one of these aspects of reading: they make many mistakes, they read slowly, or they don't read with appropriate expression and phrasing.</p>

                                    <p>Screening, diagnosing, and progress monitoring are essential to making sure that all students become fluent readers — and the words-correct per-minute (WCPM) procedure can work for all three. Here's how teachers can use it to make well-informed and timely decisions about the instructional needs of their students. </p>

                                    <p>Assessing Reading Fluency is intended to assist practitioners in monitoring students’ fluency development. Assessments are discussed in terms of three components of fluency...</p>             
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Accuracy, or accurate decoding of words in text</li>
                                        <li>Automaticity, or decoding words with minimal use of attentional resources</li>
                                        <li>Prosody, or the appropriate use of phrasing and expression to convey meaning</li>

                                    <p>What should fluency instruction look like? And, what can teachers do to help students whose fluency is far behind their peers'? This article should help practitioners use of fluency-based assessments and select instructional practices.</p>

                                    <p>Close Reading Explained: The definition of a close reading can be a little confusing for some teachers because the meaning of a close reading has recently changed with the new Common Core Standards. This video describes the purpose of the close reading and how it applies to the new Common Core standards. In this brief video, Dr Timothy Shanahan discusses the characteristics of Close Reading.</p>

                                    <p>Raz-Kids is an award-winning teaching product that provides comprehensive leveled reading resources for students. With hundreds of eBooks offered at 29 different levels of reading difficulty, it's easy to put the right content in every student's hands. Kids access their leveled text through an interactive learning portal designed to keep them motivated and engaged. Every eBook is available in online and mobile formats and allows students to listen to, read at their own pace, and record themselves reading. Students then take a corresponding eQuiz complete with an extended answer response to test comprehension and determine future instruction needs. Once a child has read ten or more of the leveled eBooks and passed each of the corresponding eQuizzes, they advance on to the next reading level where they have access to the lengthier and more difficult text.</p>
